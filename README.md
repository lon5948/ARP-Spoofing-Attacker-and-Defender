# ARP-Spoofing-Attacker-and-Defender

### Introduction
The project includes tools for ARP spoofing attacks and the aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead. On the other hand, ARP spoofing defender provides mechanisms to detect ARP spoofing attacks and protects the local network.
